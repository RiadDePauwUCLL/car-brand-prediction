![Car Classification Banner](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*tH9evuOFqk8F41FG.png)

## üìã Overview
This project implements a deep learning model that can identify **120 different car brands** from images with 75% accuracy. Built on ResNet50 architecture, the model excels at distinguishing between visually similar car models under varied lighting conditions and camera angles.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `car-classifierv1.ipynb`: Original model training implementation
- `car-classifier.ipynb`: Improved version with advanced training techniques
- `test-model.ipynb`: Tools for evaluating and visualizing model predictions
- `csv-prep.ipynb`: Data preparation and CSV processing utilities
- `price-predictor.ipynb`: Experimental price prediction component
- `/models/`: Directory for storing trained model weights
- `/cache/`: Cached preprocessed data and training states
- `/data/`: Processed image data organized by class
- `/images/`: Raw car image datasets

## üöó Features

- **Multi-class Image Classification** - Identifies car brands from standard images
- **Transfer Learning** - Leverages pre-trained ResNet50 model fine-tuned on car data
- **Advanced Data Processing** - Uses comprehensive augmentation and class balancing
- **Progressive Training** - Employs gradual layer unfreezing for optimal learning

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
```python
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2048, 2048),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(2048),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.3),
    nn.Linear(2048, 1024),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(1024),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.3),
    nn.Linear(1024, num_classes)
)
```
