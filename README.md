![Car Classification Banner](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*tH9evuOFqk8F41FG.png)

## üìã Overview
This project implements a deep learning model that can identify **120 different car brands** from images with 75% accuracy. Built on ResNet50 architecture, the model excels at distinguishing between visually similar car models under varied lighting conditions and camera angles.

## üöó Features

- **Multi-class Image Classification** - Identifies car brands from standard images
- **Transfer Learning** - Leverages pre-trained ResNet50 model fine-tuned on car data
- **Advanced Data Processing** - Uses comprehensive augmentation and class balancing
- **Progressive Training** - Employs gradual layer unfreezing for optimal learning

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Smart Brand Detection** - Automatically extracts car brands from filenames
- **Balanced Dataset Creation** - Uses stratified splitting for representative data distribution
- **Enhanced Augmentation** - Implements rotations, flips, color shifts, and erasing
- **Performance Optimization** - Employs caching mechanism for faster data loading
